## User Documentation

The data set is retrieved from UAH and includes temperature data in different regions from 1978 to 2023.

There are three panels in this app: About, Plot, and Table. 

The About panel includes general information of the data set and some sample data. 

The Plot panel includes the average temperature of each year in each region. There are three widgets in this panel: trend line, color and region. The trend line is a check box input to show or hide the trend line of the scatter plot of temperature for this region. The color widget includes several radio buttons that can change the color of the data points. The region selection widget allows users to select the region they want to view. 

The Table panel includes the average temperature by year and month. There are two radio buttons: Month and Year. The month button allows users to view the average temperature for each month, and the year button allows users to view the average temperature by year.
